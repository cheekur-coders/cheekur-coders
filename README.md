- 👋 Hi, I’m @cheekur-coders. I am not a software engineer but am fascinated with computers and how they can be better integrated in our daily lives. I love quality code and I am in the continuous process of redefining what quality code is as I learn. I have developed various python scripts, modules and packages to support my work in the corporate world. I have worked significantly on Matlab in the past to create GUI interfaces for calculators and data processors. My earliest dabblings in computer code was in C and Visual Basic.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and building small to medium scale projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fundamentals of software engineering, programming in C [re-visiting] and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow learners on medium to large scale opensource projects involving full-stack developement.
